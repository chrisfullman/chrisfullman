    You might wonder why this CSS rule below is not in the main.css file.
    As the "cascading" in CSS implies, CSS cascades from the top down.
    Like math, the order of operations is also imporant.

    Because we are importing or linking the main.css file above, the rules
    inside that CSS file are considered the top-most CSS rules for the page.

    But this rule below the comment is considered an override, meaning it will
    change the color of the p tags, even though there is a color set in the
    main.css file. Why? Because the CSS rule below is specified *after* we
    loaded the main.css file.
